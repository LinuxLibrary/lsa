Disk Partitioning in Linux using FDISK :
----------------------------------------

To list all the list of partitions on all the hdds attached to a machine
	# fdisk <options> -l

To list all the partitions on a specific hdd
	# fdisk <options> -l <Device_name>
	ex : # fdisk -cul /dev/sdc
	
	Disk /dev/sdc: 5368 MB, 5368709120 bytes
	255 heads, 63 sectors/track, 652 cylinders, total 10485760 sectors
	Units = sectors of 1 * 512 = 512 bytes
	Sector size (logical/physical): 512 bytes / 512 bytes
	I/O size (minimum/optimal): 512 bytes / 512 bytes
	Disk identifier: 0x00000000
	
	Disk /dev/sdc doesn't contain a valid partition table


Managing partitions on a hdd using FDISK utility:
-------------------------------------------------

Disk layout:
Disk layout contains 3 type of partitions.
We can create 4 partitions on a disk according to the type of partitions.

-Primary
-Extended
	-Logical

According to the above layout we can  create 4 partitions on a disk which is a total of Primary.
To overcome this design problem, extended partitions were invented. This trick allows partitioning a primary partition into sub-partitions.	
The primary partition thus subdivided is the extended partition; the sub-partitions are logical partitions.
They behave like primary partitions, but are created differently.
There is no speed difference between them.
By using an extended partition you can now have up to 15 partitions per disk.
	
To manage partitions on a disk :
	# fdisk -cu /dev/sdc
	Device contains neither a valid DOS partition table, nor Sun, SGI or OSF disklabel
	Building a new DOS disklabel with disk identifier 0x113c305f.
	Changes will remain in memory only, until you decide to write them.
	After that, of course, the previous content won't be recoverable.
	
	Warning: invalid flag 0x0000 of partition table 4 will be corrected by w(rite)
	
	Command (m for help): m
	Command action
	d   delete a partition
	l   list known partition types
	m   print this menu
	n   add a new partition
	p   print the partition table
	q   quit without saving changes
	t   change a partition's system id
	v   verify the partition table
	w   write table to disk and exit
	
	Command (m for help): p
	
	Disk /dev/sdc: 5368 MB, 5368709120 bytes

	Command (m for help): n

	e   extended

	p

	Command (m for help): w
	The partition table has been altered!
	
	Calling ioctl() to re-read partition table.
	Syncing disks.

Now we have successfully created a partition and we need to make the changes recognized and known to kernel.
	[0|dev1.linux-library.in|~]-$ partx -a /dev/sdc
	BLKPG: Device or resource busy
	error adding partition 1

Now we need to write filesystem on the partition.
	[0|dev1.linux-library.in|~]-$ mkfs /dev/sdc1
	mke2fs 1.41.12 (17-May-2010)
	Filesystem label=
	OS type: Linux
	Block size=1024 (log=0)
	Fragment size=1024 (log=0)
	Stride=0 blocks, Stripe width=0 blocks
	128016 inodes, 512000 blocks
	25600 blocks (5.00%) reserved for the super user
	First data block=1
	Maximum filesystem blocks=67633152
	63 block groups
	8192 blocks per group, 8192 fragments per group
	2032 inodes per group
	Superblock backups stored on blocks:
			8193, 24577, 40961, 57345, 73729, 204801, 221185, 401409
	
	Writing inode tables: done
	Writing superblocks and filesystem accounting information: done
	
	This filesystem will be automatically checked every 29 mounts or
	180 days, whichever comes first.  Use tune2fs -c or -i to override.

Now create a directory and mount the partition on that directory.
	[0|dev1.linux-library.in|~]-$ mkdir /testdisk
	[0|dev1.linux-library.in|~]-$ mount -t ext4 /dev/sdc1 /testdisk/

To make this partition mounted at the time of startup we need to make this changes permanent by adding those details to /etc/fstab
Before doing that please back it up. After that add the details of the newly added partition to the fstab
	[0|dev1.linux-library.in|~]-$ cp -prv /etc/fstab /etc/fstab.20160107
	`/etc/fstab' -> `/etc/fstab.20160107'
	[0|dev1.linux-library.in|~]-$ vi /etc/fstab
	/dev/sdc1	/testdisk	ext4	defaults	0 0
