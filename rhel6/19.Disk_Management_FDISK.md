# Disk Partitioning in Linux using FDISK
---

- To list all the list of partitions on all the hdds attached to a machine

```
	# fdisk <options> -l
```

- To list all the partitions on a specific hdd

```
	# fdisk <options> -l <Device_name>
	ex : # fdisk -cul /dev/sdc
	
	Disk /dev/sdc: 5368 MB, 5368709120 bytes
	255 heads, 63 sectors/track, 652 cylinders, total 10485760 sectors
	Units = sectors of 1 * 512 = 512 bytes
	Sector size (logical/physical): 512 bytes / 512 bytes
	I/O size (minimum/optimal): 512 bytes / 512 bytes
	Disk identifier: 0x00000000
	
	Disk /dev/sdc doesn't contain a valid partition table
```

- Managing partitions on a hdd using FDISK utility:

	***Disk layout***

	- Disk layout contains 3 type of partitions.
	- We can create 4 partitions on a disk according to the type of partitions.


	```
	-> Primary
	-> Extended
		-> Logical
	```

	- According to the above layout we can  create 4 partitions on a disk which is a total of Primary.
	- To overcome this design problem, extended partitions were invented. This trick allows partitioning a primary partition into sub-partitions.	
	- The primary partition thus subdivided is the extended partition; the sub-partitions are logical partitions.
	- They behave like primary partitions, but are created differently.
	- There is no speed difference between them.
	- By using an extended partition you can now have up to 15 partitions per disk.
	
	- To manage partitions on a disk :

	```
	# fdisk -cu /dev/sdc
	Device contains neither a valid DOS partition table, nor Sun, SGI or OSF disklabel
	Building a new DOS disklabel with disk identifier 0x113c305f.
	Changes will remain in memory only, until you decide to write them.
	After that, of course, the previous content won't be recoverable.
	
	Warning: invalid flag 0x0000 of partition table 4 will be corrected by w(rite)

	```

- Now we have successfully created a partition and we need to make the changes recognized and known to kernel.

	```
	[0|dev1.linux-library.in|~]-$ partx -a /dev/sdc
	BLKPG: Device or resource busy
	error adding partition 1
	```

- Now we need to write filesystem on the partition.

	```
	[0|dev1.linux-library.in|~]-$ mkfs /dev/sdc1
	mke2fs 1.41.12 (17-May-2010)
	Filesystem label=
	OS type: Linux
	Block size=1024 (log=0)
	Fragment size=1024 (log=0)
	Stride=0 blocks, Stripe width=0 blocks
	128016 inodes, 512000 blocks
	25600 blocks (5.00%) reserved for the super user
	First data block=1
	Maximum filesystem blocks=67633152
	63 block groups
	8192 blocks per group, 8192 fragments per group
	2032 inodes per group
	Superblock backups stored on blocks:
			8193, 24577, 40961, 57345, 73729, 204801, 221185, 401409
	
	Writing inode tables: done
	Writing superblocks and filesystem accounting information: done
	
	This filesystem will be automatically checked every 29 mounts or
	180 days, whichever comes first.  Use tune2fs -c or -i to override.
	```

- Now create a directory and mount the partition on that directory.

	```
	[0|dev1.linux-library.in|~]-$ mkdir /testdisk
	[0|dev1.linux-library.in|~]-$ mount -t ext4 /dev/sdc1 /testdisk/
	```

- To make this partition mounted at the time of startup we need to make this changes permanent by adding those details to /etc/fstab
- Before doing that please back it up. After that add the details of the newly added partition to the fstab

	```
	[0|dev1.linux-library.in|~]-$ cp -prv /etc/fstab /etc/fstab.20160107
	`/etc/fstab' -> `/etc/fstab.20160107'
	[0|dev1.linux-library.in|~]-$ vi /etc/fstab
	/dev/sdc1	/testdisk	ext4	defaults	0 0
	```
